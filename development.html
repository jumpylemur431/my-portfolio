            <h3 class="sub-titles">Context</h3>
            <p class="p-text">This application allows <b>users to buy albums by GOT7</b>, a South Korean K-pop boy group.
                The goal is to allow users to browse all released albums by the group and buy them.
                The value of the website is to allow users or GOT7 fans to have a <b>one-stop shop to
                buy all the albums or EPs</b> they would like, with <b>detailed sorting and filtering </b>on each
                item.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Why React?</h3>
            <p class="p-text">This application is an exploration in using <b>React, a JavaScript library for building
                user interfaces quickly and efficiently. </b> In React, users can develop applications by 
                creating reusable components. Therefore, multiple components such as cards and cart items 
                are re-used in this React app, all while developed in JavaScript and CSS.

            <h3 class="sub-titles">React Usability Principles</h3>
            <p class="p-text"> React usability principles were incorporated in the <b>filters and sorts</b> I included on the page.
                For general users who would like to browse albums, there are sorts for the <b>price
                and popularity of the albums</b>. For more serious
                K-pop or GOT7 fans, they can learn further details on the album such as the <b>lead single producer</b> or the 
            <b>number of songs on an album.</b> The filters lie on the left of the page with
                the cart on the right to view all major components of the page at once.</p>

            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">State Changes</h3>
            <p class="p-text"> For component state changes, there five states that change. The first is <b>sorting</b> that is updated
                as a new sort type is selected. Next is the <b>filters</b> that updates when a certain filter is checked in the 
                check-mark box. Next is the <b>cart</b> that is updated with albums as they are added to the cart. Similarly, the 
            <b>total</b> amount is updated with an integer value depending on item price. Finally, the cart and filters can be 
        <b>cleared or reset</b> as needed which changes state.

            <h3 class="sub-titles">Low Fidelity Mock-up</h3>
            <p class="p-text">The following low fidelity mock-up covers the major parts of the React
                web application. There are <b>three</b> main divs that split the page by the ratio <b>20:60:20</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">The largest div includes the <b>album cards</b>. These will include the album cover image,
                the name,
                and additional information that the albums are sorted by. These cards are dynamically changing
                depending on the filters selected by users
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">The left-most div includes all the <b>filters and sorting options</b>. First are sorting
                options
                in the form of radio buttons (not pictured in the design). The second are the two filters: by
                album type and producer in the form of checkboxes. There is also a reset button to reset all filters
                and sorts.
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">The right-most div is the <b>cart</b> for users to add each album to. The cart total
                updates
                as users add more items to the cart. The count of each album can also be updated in the cart to include
                more or less depeding on the users preference. Finally, they can checkout with the selected album
                names once they have completed shopping. They can also clear the cart to resert shopping.

            <h3 class="sub-titles">Insights</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In this project, I learned how exactly <b>React works in building responsive 
                and interactive webpages.</b> I built my JavaScript knowledge through this project and found
                the value of building webpages with React.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="p-text">A takeaway I had in this project was <b>React components.</b> With React components, 
                since they are reusable, time is saved as I <b>do not need to write different code for the same features.</b> 
                Additionally, if I make any changes to a certain part, it does not affect other components in the application.

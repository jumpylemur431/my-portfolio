            <h3 class="sub-titles">Context</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In this project, my team viewed the start-up <b>Discz, 
                the hottest new social media and music app.</b> As a team, we <b>designed a new interactive solution</b> to
            their current application released on the Apple App store in a more intuitive
            and user-focused way to make the start-up more successful. As a UX Designer and Researcher team,
            we were able to redesign and gather feedback from users on our high fidelity prototype.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Why?</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In our team's experience using the application, we had a few issues with the app
                 that we wanted to fix in the new design. With the application UX, users are <b>unable to make multiple playlists depending
                 on the genre</b>. We found this difficult as most users have varying genre tastes and one playlist to encompass
                 it all may not be the best playlist to listen to. With UX, we also found the <b>swiping
                 action confusing.</b> There is no indication as to which side is needed to swipe and like
                 or dislike the song. With the application UI, we had issues with the <b>navigation bar and
                 the profile page. </b>

            <h3 class="sub-titles">Start-up</h3>
            <p class="p-text">Discz was founded in 2021 by Bobby Pinckney and Michelle Yin. They joined Y combinator in the Winter of 2022.
                The core conecpt behind Discz is that it is a <b>Spotify-integrated music 
                discovery platform</b> built to help users find their next favorite artists and songs. 
                The main functionality is the ability to build playlists at the swipe of a finger 
                and find new music via custom recommendations catered to user tastes! 
                Users can swipe through song snippets to find music they love and add it to 
                their spotify playlists. Since launching in March, Discz has consistently ranked 
                top 10 in the App Store music charts with over <b>300,000 monthly active users 
                and 3 million song saves per week.</b></p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Current Application Design</h3>
            <p class="p-text">Before starting our redesign, we downloaded the current Discz application to test the product. 
                Here is where we found the user problems we described above. Here are some <b>screenshots from the current 
                UI of the application.</b> The following
                screens include the <b>Feed page, Recs page, Explore page, and
                 Playlist page. </b>
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-h2">Design Iterations</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Low Fidelity Mock-ups</h3>
            <p class="p-text">For our low fidelity mock-ups, we had four ideas for what the 
                new design for Discz should look like, covering the major problems outlined above. 
                The four designs were based off of current apps with easy to use user design: 
            <b>TikTok, Pandora, Netflix, and Spotify.</b> The wireframes were designed in Balsamiq. 
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">For the final wireframe, we <b>combined the design of 
            Spotify, Tinder, and Instagram</b>, in a simplified way for the new Discz design. In 
                our designs, we covered what the three major nagivations tabs would be: 
            <b>Discover, Playlist, and Profile. </b> Our Profile page is similar to Instagram while the
            Playlist and Discover pages are simplified versions of Spotify. Finally, the swiping action to like
            and dislike songs is inspired by Tinder's simple UI style. These can be viewed in our final project page 
            linked in the button below. s
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">High Fidelity Mock-ups</h3>
            <p class="p-text">The final high fidelity mock-up was developed in <b>Figma</b>. In this mock-up, 
                the overall design and UI was decided and design. We also made our <b>Figma prototype clickable </b>
            allowing users to experience using the application and its features such as swiping on songs or viewing their
        profile.  </p>
            <p class="p-text">An additional change we made is in the <b>color scheme and logo of Discz.</b> 
                The color scheme of the original app is too excessive. Therefore, we simplified colors to be teal, 
                black and white. The logo shape is kept, but with a single color instead of an ombre and in the 
                2D plane.

            <h3 class="sub-titles">Student Critiques</h3>
            <p class="p-text">As a group, we gathered <b>critiques from fellow students</b> on our initial Discz design. Using their 
                critiques, we made changes to our high-fidelity model. We gained <b>useful positive and constructive feedback.</b> For example
                students enjoyed our new color scheme for the application and the clean UI. On the other hand, 
                they found some of our buttons unintuitive such as the "+" button we had in the Discover page. 
            <h3 class="sub-titles">UserTesting</h3>
            <h4 class="sub-sub-titles">What is UserTesting?</h4>
            <p class="p-text">UserTesting is an <b>online resource for UX designers to test their designs</b>
                to anonymous individuals around the world. Individuals sign-up and are paid to user test 
                a variety of designs, prototypes, and softwares made by developers. Our team used UserTesting in order to <b>test our final version of the high fidelity
                Figma mock-up.</b> We were reviewed by <b>four individuals.</b> Each of their experiences using our mock-up 
                were screen recorded.
            <h4 class="sub-sub-titles">Testing Process</h4>
            <p class="p-text">We asked users to <b>complete four tasks.</b> In these tasks, they needed to 
                interact with the prototype in a certain way and in a specific order. Once they completed a task,
                we <b>asked additional questions</b> for them to describe the experience on each page and 
                whether or not they were intuitive or difficult to understand.  </p>
            <h4 class="sub-sub-titles">Testing Results</h4>
            <p class="p-text">In our testing results, we found users had an <b>overall positive experience
                with the app </b>and found it to be <b>intuitive.</b> We found users had some issues with our swipping functionality 
                in the Discover section. They were also unclear about how to create new radios. There was an average 
            <b> intuitivity score of 4.5 </b>for all three major pages. </p>

            <h2 class="section-h2">Conclusion</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Insights</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In this project, I learned the importance of <b>gathering detailed feedback.</b> Simply assuming
                certain aspects of a product design is clear or only focusing on UI is not enough. Instead, as a UI/UX Designer,
            <b>every aspect of design must be considered.</b> The best way to get clear feedback on design assumptions and descisions 
                is to talk to users and listen, taking their feedback and making the necessary changes.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="p-text">A takeaway from this project is the <b>usefulness of tools like UserTesting </b>on the Internet. 
                User testing of any form is extremely useful in <b>ensuring your design is intuitive and understandable </b>
                to the average user. If not, a product will not succesful reach the needs of a user.

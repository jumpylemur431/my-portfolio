            <h3 class="sub-titles">Context</h3>
            <p class="p-text">User Experience is a fundamental aspect of product design. To understand the value of user experience
                this project reviews a common interface a digital payment platform: <b>Toast Point of Sale (POS) Platform</b>. 
                In this review, I observered and interviewed users of the interface at Charuma Tea Bar. 
                In order to know the users of the product well, UX designers make user personas and storyboard
                the entire user experience. Therefore, for this review, I desgined two personas and a storyboard
                based on my UX research. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Why?</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In most cafes, there are multiple ways cafe-goers pay for their drinks or snacks.
                 I, for instance, tend to use my iPhone Apple Pay method but other cafe-goers use 
                 their card chip, tap, or swipe capabilities. There are also capabilities to view
                  the order amount, add tip, join rewards programs, and receive the receipt that 
                  adds to the user experience when paying for a drink or snack at the cafe. Therefore, this project allowed
                for a deeper exploration of a cafe system users, and myself, interact with everyday.</p>

            <h2 class="section-h2">User Research</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">User Observations</h3>
            <p class="p-text">I observered <b>three different users</b> each and the actions they took  when interacting
                with the Toast Interface. From each user, I made object observations of their interation, from how long 
                the experience took, the payment method selected, to how many times they touched the screen. Their unique experiences 
                helped me better understand <b>how users broadly interact with the interface</b> and <b>user patterns</b>. This process took around an hour at Charuma Tea Bar.  
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">User Interviews</h3>
            <p class="p-text">I also conducted <b>interviews with 10 of the users</b> of the Toast Interface within a three hour time span. 
                I asked users to answer questions in regards to their experience with the interface and their 
                motivations to use the interface in certain ways. By asking these questions, I gained <b>first hand thoughts and feelings
                from users</b> to better understand what the user is considering when interacting with the interface.

            <h2 class="section-h2">User Results</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Personas</h3>
            <p class="p-text">Using the data collected from observations and interviews, I created <b>two user personas</b>. 
                The personas are based on overarching trends observed amongst all the users. I created two personas, <b>Sam and Lisa</b>. 
                Both Lisa and Sam, although different experiences, represent two types of users who interact with the Toast platform: 
                the confident user and the confused user. To further build the personas, I created a <b>four-quadrant empathy map </b>
                describing what each persona thinks, feels, says, and does with the platform. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Storyboarding</h3>
            <p class="p-text">After designing personas, I created a <b>storyboard for their user journey
                 from start to end</b>. I took the persona Lisa and reflected their experience using the Toast interface. 
                The storyboard <b>reflects the goals of the persona</b> and includes all necessary six steps for using the interface.

            <h2 class="section-h2">Conclusion</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Insights</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In this project, I learned the <b>importance of conducting user experience research</b>. 
                Simply assuming what the user wants in a product will not produce a simple product. Instead, 
                going to the user and observering their actions and asking questions will yield to 
                interesting insights that can be useful in designing a better product user experience. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="p-text">A takewaway I had for this project is how <b>developing personas and storyboarding
                can more clearly build a user story</b>. There are so many users that may use a product but telling 
                the story data provides with an empathy map or a storyboard clarifies what their needs, wants, 
                and frustrations are that is invaluable information to the product designer.

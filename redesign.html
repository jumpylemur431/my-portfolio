            <h3 class="sub-titles">Context</h3>
            <p class="p-text">For this project, I selected <b>my high school's, Bishop Guertin High School, course offerings webpage</b> to 
                <b>improve the workflow of and redesign.</b>
                By identifying and analyzing the flaws, I was able to make a redesign for the webpage with a low fidelity, 
                high fidelity, and then final responsive webpage in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Why?</h3>
            <p class="p-text">Upon viewing my high school's webpage, I found some clear issues 
                that needed to be fixed. These issues fell into the buckets of <b>usability, learnability, memorability, 
                and conceptual model</b>. These four criteria for the usability of a webpage are not currently reached 
                in its design. Therefore, in this project, by <b>first identifying the problem and then 
                redesigning the webpage</b>, I learned how to find properly address issues I see on a webpage.

            <h2 class="section-h2">UX Research</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Website Research</h3>
            <p class="p-text">This the website of my high school that I attended from 9th to 12th grade. 
                This website was most recently redo, around 5 years ago, and since its redesign, I have noticed 
                multiple flaws. Specifically, the page I find has a <b>bad workflow is the Course Offerings page</b>.
                 The website could be updated with a different font sizes and more focus on UI/UX friendliness. 
                Select the button below to view the current website.

            </a>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Accessibility</h3>
            <p class="p-text">Using the <b>WAIVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</b>, I found there were <b>14 errors, 12 contrast errors,
                 125 alerts, and 4 features</b> on the webpage. For the most part, I agree with the errors. Most of them include 
                 missing alternative text or having broken links. The larger problem is the contrast errors with 
                 some of the font colors on the website which should definitely be changed. There are some alerts 
                 which I think are not as much of an issue such as a missing heading where there is instead a picture. 
                 Overall, this test provided valuable insights into what I must fix for 
                 this website redesign.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-titles">Low Fidelity Mock-ups</h3>
            <p class="p-text">After research on the usability problems on the page
                I made <b>low fidelity designs </b>for the <b>desktop, tablet, and phone.</b>
                The mock-ups were made on Balsamiq which allowed me to make a basic blueprint of the page without 
                adding too much details. In my low fidelity mock-ups, I made a <b>one-page mock-up</b> although the page itself would
                require scrolling. Finally, I made <b>annotations that can be found on
                yellow sticky notes</b> on each mock-up to make notes of what the design elements would be and what problems 
            each element solves. </p>

            <h3 class="sub-titles">High Fidelity Mock-ups</h3>
            <p class="p-text">Next I made <b>high fidelity mock-ups on the desktop, tablet, and phone</b> for the webpage. 
                The mock-ups were made on Figma which allowed for detailed visual of what the page would look like. Similarily, annotations can be found on the 
                yellow sticky notes on each mock-up with more details such as the CSS necesary and whether information is located in a certain div.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-titles">Insights</h3>
            <p class="p-text">In this project, I learned the importance of using the <b>usability
                framework to find issues on webpages</b>. Using the framework, I was able to find major issues with the webpage
                that would make for a better user experience. Breaking down the issues by type, I could
                then think of solutions to improve each issue. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-titles">Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="p-text">One takeaway I have is to make <b>low and high fidelity mock-ups 
                before writing code</b> for a design project. With the mock-ups, I learned the importance 
                of having an idea of the design before starting to code. The mock-ups made the coding process
                easier since I had an idea of how to build the site before hand.
